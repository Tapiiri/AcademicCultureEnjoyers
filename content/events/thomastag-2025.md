Thomastag is a spectacular chance to experience German student culture at its most festive. We'll travel together to Nürnberg — a city famous for its medieval charm, world-class Christmas market, and Southern German fraternity traditions.

The highlight of the weekend is a **Kommers** (a festive, sitsit-style evening of song, toasts, and tradition) followed by a _Bummel_ (visiting local fraternities). Around that, we'll explore Nürnberg, enjoy its Christmas market, and share the season in good company.
